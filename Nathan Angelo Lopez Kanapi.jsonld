      "@value": "I majored in AB-Psychology (US based) with a log of modern Filipino psychology included. I also have a degree in the culinary arts and restaurant management. I was a small business owner, so I have experience with basic legalities for setting up local businesses. My brother is a lawyer. I also have experience with Japanese business laws when I worked there as a manager. Before I opened up a business, I worked several years in a kitchen and in US IT outsourced HR. I speak English, Filipino and Japanese fluently. I can also hold most conversations in Spanish and am currently learning Korean (wife is Korean). In terms of cultural heritage, I am part Spanish and Chinese so I'm familiar with both cultures. As of recently, I have also learned about Africa. While individually unremarkable, I believe that combined, all my life experiences have provided me a unique view on how global communities operate and the challenges of cross cultural communication. \n\n*I also shitpost a lot on Twitter"
